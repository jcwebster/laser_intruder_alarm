laser_intruder_alarm
The cat was annoying me so I built an infrared trip-wire system that triggers a laser and buzzer to scare it off should it try to enter my room.

This project uses an Arduino Pro Mini, laser emitter, passive buzzer, and IR sensor.

The alarm is triggered when an object passes in front of the IR sensor, which emits and detects IR light.
When the alarm is triggered, a two-tone alarm sounds twice and the laser is turned on, and the device remains in this state until the IR sensor path is cleared.

To add in the near future:
2x servo motors to control 2-axis position of laser to distract an intruder and guide it out.
